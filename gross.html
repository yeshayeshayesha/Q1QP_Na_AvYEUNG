                    The pie chart shows the average box office sales per genre. From what can be observed, the superhero genre accumulated the highest average box office sales of $971,046,917.7. From this, we can conclude that the superhero genre tends to be more successful in terms of gross sales compared to other movie genres. A reason for this could be because  superhero movies tend to have a larger audience because of their lower age rating and appeal to most generations. This genre can give the audience a role model to look up to and can incorporate universal themes to relate to viewers but still be exciting and action-packed. Thriller movies have the lowest average gross sales, with an average gross sale of $472,507,789.7. This could be due to higher age ratings and sensitive themes that are usually observed in thriller movies.
