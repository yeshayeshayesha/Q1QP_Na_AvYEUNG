        <h1>CONCLUSION</h1>

                <p>Before anything else, the reader should keep in mind that the numerical data presented in this paper are not exact amounts. There could be variance in the actual values or statistics of these movies. </p>

            <div class="boex">
                <p>The average gross sales per movie is $730,388,056 as calculated using the median, and the average production budget per movie is $169,405,303.03, also using the median. The majority of the movies part of the top 12 from 2018 - 2023 are of the action genre, however, based on the average gross sales per genre, we can conclude that the superhero genre is the most successful genre in the box office, and the thriller genre is the least successful.</p>

            <div class="boex">
                <p>The average production budget is  $170,000,000.00 based on the median. This data was calculated using 66 of the 72 movies which had available budgets as some movies, specifically those made in China, had undisclosed budgets. Based on the histogram and FDT of the production budgets, we can conclude that most of the movies accounted for had a production budget that ranged from $72,630,383.50 to $243,271,535.50.</p>
            </div> 
            <div class="boex">
                <p> Based on our data set, Walt Disney Studios produced the majority of the movies part of the top 12 from 2018-2023, producing notable movies such as “Avengers: Infinity War” and “Avengers: Endgame”, the latter having earned the highest gross sales among the movies released from 2018 - 2023. However, relatively smaller companies such as Beijing Enlight, China Film Co. have also produced movies that are part of the top 12, which concludes that small movie production companies should not be undervalued in the film industry that is mainly dominated by large corporations such as Walt Disney and Universal Pictures.</p>
